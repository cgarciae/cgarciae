## ¬°Hola! üëã 

I'm Cristian Garcia, a Machine Learning Engineer from üá®üá¥ Colombia working on Open Source at Quansight. I'm part of the Flax team and contribute to many JAX related repositories, as well as some data engineering projects.

### Projects
These are the projects which I am currently contributing to:

- [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax): A neural network library and ecosystem for JAX designed for flexibility. 
- [Pypeln](https://github.com/cgarciae/pypeln): A simple yet powerful Python library for creating concurrent data pipelines.
- [Ciclo](https://github.com/cgarciae/ciclo): A functional training loops library for JAX.
- [JAX Metrics](https://github.com/cgarciae/jax_metrics): A Metrics library for the JAX ecosystem.
- [Simple Pytree](https://github.com/cgarciae/simple-pytree): A dead simple Python package for creating custom JAX pytree objects.

Note: I contribute to Flax as part day job in a colaboration between Google and Quansight.

If you find my work interesting and useful, please consider sponsoring me. Your support will help me continue to maintain and improve these projects, as well as develop new ones. Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
